# Hello, World!

Welcome to my _shiny new_ blog!

## About Me

First, a little bit about me: My name is Will, and I'm an aspiring full-stack
web developer. I'm about 9 months into my journey of learning how to program,
and I'm loving (_almost_) every minute of it!

## About this Blog

I plan to use this blog as a place to share my thoughts and discoveries as a
burgeoning programmer. There's an old saying that "we teach best what we need
to learn most," and I've found that to be true over and over again in my life.
Primarily, this blog is just meant to be a dumping ground for the things I'm
learning about. I can't promise that what I write here will be worth reading,
but I can promise that I'll learn a lot just by writing it.

Thanks for reading!
