  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I've been a professional church musician for the past ten years. Now, I'm
    learning how to program as I seek a career in full-stack web development!
    I'm married to the beautiful and talented Nancy, and the Lord has blessed us
    with two wonderful boys named Oliver and Sullivan.
  </p>

  <h2>What I'm Learning</h2>
  <p>
    Ever since being introduced to the world of computer science and
    programming, I've been spending most of my free time learning new things and
    building cool stuff. I'm curious by nature, and the sheer amount of things
    to discover in this field is incredible! Beyond the standard web development
    stuff, I'm also interested in learning more about systems programming and
    low-level languages like C and Rust.

  <h2>What's up with the ðŸ¦†?</h2>
  <p>
    Ducks are cool little guys. Some might even call them <em>majestic.</em> I enjoy
    watching ducks, feeding ducks, and collecting duck memorabilia. There are worse
    hobbies.
