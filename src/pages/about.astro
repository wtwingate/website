    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
      Hey there, my name's Will. I've been working as a church musician for the
      past ten years. Now, I'm learning how to program as I seek a career in
      full-stack web development! I'm married to the beautiful and talented
      Nancy, and the Lord has blessed us with two wonderful boys.

    <h2>What's up with the ðŸ¦†?</h2>
    <p>
      Ducks are pretty cool. I like looking at ducks, feeding ducks, and
      collecting duck paraphernalia. There are worse hobbies.
